								<h3>Rocket Beavers</h3>
								<p>Rocket Beavers is a robotics team of highly motivated students from the Avon Old Farms School. With various skills such as Engineering, Programming, and 3D Modeling, we build robots with a common passion for the field of robotics.</p>

								<h4>Team History</h4>
								<p>We are the Avon Old Farms Rocket Beavers and this is our fifth year competing in First Tech Challenge. We attend Avon Old Farms School, an all-boys preparatory school in Avon, Connecticut. We work out of the Forge, a recently-renovated building on our campus. Built-in 1927, it was Avon’s original Blacksmithing building where most of the campus's door knobs, hinges, and lampposts were handcrafted in the early days of the school. Two years ago it was renovated to create a space of our emerging program. This past year, we also converted the attached water tower into a computer lab. </p>

								<h4>Team Goals</h4>
								<p>Since we are a fairly new team. We are working to learn what works well and what we need to do to be successful. Ultimately our team’s goal this year is to create a solid foundation? For the future of our robotics team. We also hope to make it at least to regionals. One big aspect of the competition that we would like to improve on is our engineering notebook. We have played around with different templates. But still do not have a template that we think is sustainable and aesthetically pleasing. B </p>
